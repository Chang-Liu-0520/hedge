Installing Hedge
================

This tutorial will walk you through the process of building
:mod:`hedge`. To follow, you really only need three basic things:

* A UNIX-like machine with web access.
* A C++ compiler, preferably a Version 4.x gcc.
* A working `Python <http://www.python.org>`_ installation, 
  Version 2.4 or newer.

Hedge *can* take advantage of some extra packages:

* `BLAS <http://netlib.org/blas>`_ (will result in substantial speedup)
* `libsilo <https://wci.llnl.gov/codes/silo/>`_ (write Silo visualization files)
* `MPI <http://www.mpi-forum.org>`_ (compute in parallel), 
  via Boost.MPI and its Python wrapper 
  `boostmpi <http://mathema.tician.de/software/boostmpi>`_.
* `CUDA <http://nvidia.com/cuda>`_ (compute on graphics cards).
  via `PyCuda <http://mathema.tician.de/software/pycuda>`_.

In this tutorial, we will build a basic version of hedge that does not
need any of these.

Step 1: Build Boost
-------------------

You may already have a working copy of the `Boost C++ libraries
<http://www.boost.org>`_. If so, make sure that it's version 1.37.0 or newer.
If not, no problem, there are simple `instructions
<http://mathema.tician.de/software/install-boost>`_ on how to build and install
boost available.

Step 2: Install Boost.Bindings
------------------------------

Download the most recent release of the Boost Bindings from `here
<http://mathema.tician.de/software/boost-numeric-bindings>`_ and
type::

    $ tar xfz ~/download/boost-numeric-bindings-20YYMMDD.tar.gz
    $ cd boost-numeric-bindings
    $ ./configure --prefix=$HOME/pool
    $ make install

Change the "YYMMDD" to match the release you downloaded. Note that
this is a header-only library, so all it needs to do for installation
is copy some files.

Step 3: Create and Customize a Configuration File
-------------------------------------------------

Copy and paste the following text into a file called
:file:`.aksetup-defaults.py` (Make sure not to miss
the initial dot, it's important.) in your home directory::

    BOOST_BINDINGS_INC_DIR = ['/home/andreas/pool/include/boost-numeric-bindings']
    BOOST_INC_DIR = ['/home/andreas/pool/include/boost-1_37']
    BOOST_LIB_DIR = ['/home/andreas/pool/lib']
    BOOST_PYTHON_LIBNAME = ['boost_python-gcc43-mt']

You will need to adapt the path names in this file to your personal
situation, of course.

Additionally, make sure that the compiler tag in
`BOOST_PYTHON_LIBNAME` matches your boost libraries. (It's `gcc43` in
the example, which stands for gcc Version 4.3. Yours may be different.
Find out by looking at the directory listing of :file:`$HOME/pool/lib`, or
wherever you installed the Boost libraries.)

Optional: Tell :mod:`hedge` about BLAS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you have the `Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines <http://netlib.org/blas>`_
or a tuned implementation such as `ATLAS <http://math-atlas.sf.net>`_ available,
you may tell hedge about their presence for a big speed boost. Simply add the 
following three lines to the file :file:`.aksetup-defaults.py` in your home
directory that you created just now::

    HAVE_BLAS = True
    BLAS_LIB_DIR = ['/where/ever/your/blas/is']
    BLAS_LIBNAME = ['your_blas_libname'] # without leading lib and trailing .a/.so

If you are using ATLAS, you may need to specify a combination of
libraries similar to these::

    BLAS_LIBNAME = ['f77blas', 'atlas', 'gfortran'] # example if using atlas

Step 4: Download and Unpack hedge
---------------------------------

Download the latest `release of hedge
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/hedge>`_. Then do this::

    $ tar xfz hedge-VERSION.tar.gz

Step 5: Install Numpy
---------------------

If you donâ€™t already have `numpy <http://numpy.org>`_ installed, this
is an easy way to install it::

    $ cd hedge-VERSION
    $ sudo python ez_setup.py # this will install setuptools
    $ sudo easy_install numpy # this will install numpy using setuptools

Note that installing numpy can take a few minutes, this is normal.

Step 6: Build and Install hedge
-------------------------------

Actually compiling and installing hedge should now be fairly simple::

    $ cd hedge-VERSION # if you're not there already
    $ sudo python setup.py install

Get some coffee while hedge and its dependencies are installed. If
you get no errors, congratulations! You have successfully built hedge.

For your information: This step in the installation will automatically
download and install (or update) the correct versions of the following
packages:

* Pytools
* Pymbolic
* PyUblas
* MeshPy

Success! So what now?
---------------------

One of the first things you might want to try is running hedge's unit tests. Follow me::

    $ cd hedge-VERSION/test
    $ python test_hedge.py
    ...............................
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ran 31 tests in 35.187s

    OK

Once that succeeds, you're all set. Next, I'd suggest you go and play
with the wave equation example for a bit::

    $ cd hedge-VERSION/examples/wave
    $ python wave-min.py
    (stuff happens for a little while)

Now download `VisIt <https://wci.llnl.gov/codes/visit/>`_ and marvel
at the output. :) Then, point your editor at `wave-min.py` and start
tinkering.

Have fun!
