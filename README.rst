hedge is an unstructured, high-order, parallel
Discontinuous Galerkin solver for partial differential
equations.

Features:

* Supports simplicial unstructured meshes in two and
  three dimensions (i.e. triangles and tetrahedra)
* Approximates using orthogonal polynomials of any degree
  (and therefore to any order of accuracy) you specify at
  runtime
* Solves PDEs in parallel using MPI and GPUs
* Easy to use
* Powerful Parallel Visualization
