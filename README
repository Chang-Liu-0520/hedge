Welcome to Hedge!
-----------------

Hedge is the 

  Hybrid'n'Easy Discontinuous Galerkin Environment.

It is a "hybrid" because it is written in both Python and C++. The Python
part takes care of high-level control, while the low-level C++ part takes
care of crunching the numbers, resulting in a fast code that is extremely
easy to use.

To compile Hedge, you need the following prerequisites:

- Boost 1.34 or newer
